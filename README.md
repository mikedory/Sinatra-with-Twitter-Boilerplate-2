Sinatra-with-Twitter-Boilerplate-2
==================================

Just a quickstart repo for making Sinatra apps that use Boilerplate


Bower
-----

Packages for web things are managed by [Bower](https://github.com/twitter/bower).  If you don't have Bower, fix that!

    npm install bower -g

Using it is easy â€” just kick it off like so:

    bower install jquery
    bower install bootstrap

That will clone and cache jQuery and Twitter Bootstrap for you, and you're good to go.
